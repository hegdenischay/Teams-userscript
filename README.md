# Teams-userscript
The userscript that I made because I have some pet peeves with how Teams calls work

I have a major problem with how teams calls work: they don't let me use keyboard shortcuts to do simple thigs!

Therefore, I decided to make a userscript that does that for me.

Install this using your favourite userscript manager and it should work.
