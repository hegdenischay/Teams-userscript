# Teams-userscript
The userscript that I made because I have some pet peeves with how Teams calls work

I have a major problem with how teams calls work: they don't let me use keyboard shortcuts to do simple thigs!

Therefore, I decided to make a userscript that does that for me.

Install this using your favourite userscript manager and it should work.

# How to Install

- This was coded for [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), but it should also be compatible with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
- Install either of the userscript managers above, and then [Install](https://github.com/hegdenischay/Teams-userscript/raw/master/teams-keyboard.user.js).

# Current Features

- Press 'f' or 'F' to enter full screen mode.
- Press 'm' or 'M' to toggle the microphone.
- Press 'h' or 'H' to hang up.
